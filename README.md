A MOBA/RTS prototype game developped under Unity (Unity5.4, PUN)

First of all this project is a prototype. It was a school project developped over 2 years.
We were 6 students to work on it, at around 5 hours a week.
The project has been modified and reworked multiple times, but we finally ended up with a prototype.

To be clear, this project is big, a bit messy, and the prototype is unbalanced, lacks of fun, and there may remains some bugs.
But this is not really a problem, since the goal of this project is not to produce a sellable game. Indeed, the purpose was to learn the full process behind the creation of a video game.
Of course it would have been great to get a fully finished and polished game, but as we were newbies in video game developpement, we basically felt in every trap lying in the video game creation process, and we lost a lot of time.

Nevertheless, this experience was a great success on the pedagogic side. Among the countless skill we learn, i can think of :
 - working in team over a long period of time
 - being well organised
 - getting more skill in C# and with Unity3D
 - producing a high quality documentation
 - working with artists (2D, 3D)
 - getting some skills in game and level design
 
 
The project is over today, after 2 years of hard work, we commonly decided to stop it.
